Teensy 4.1 should have at least 16MB or more of external RAM soldered into Teensy 4.1 PSRAM pads. Should either be soldered or connected to the Teensy Audio Adapter Card, also Teensy Audio Adapter Card should have an additional 2Gbit of Flash RAM soldered in the Audio Adapter.

installing
```
mkdir iridescentBUILD; cd iridescentBUILD
git checkout https://github.com/8888clockradio/iridescentmicropython.git
```

edit iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/toolchain.mk

change
```
LIBPATHFILEDROP = /Users/iridescent/iridescent/iridescentCoconutSynth2/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-darwin-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/12.2.0/thumb/v7e-m+dp/hard
COMPILERPATH = /Users/iridescent/iridescent/iridescentCoconutSynth2/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-darwin-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/bin
TOOLSPATH = /Applications/Teensyduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools
```

to the path of your arm-none-eabi gcc and g++ toolchain, try and use current versions not the Teensyduino.app included one download arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-darwin-arm64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz or similar from

keep thumb/v7e-m+dp/hard in the LIBPATHFILEDROP and make sure you add /bin to COMPILERPATH

change /Applications/Teensyduino.app in TOOLSPATH if Teensyduino is installed in a non-standard location
```
https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads
```

copy the .xz file to iridescentBUILD/
extract the .xz file in iridescentBUILD/
should look like
```
iridescentBUILD/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-darwin-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/...
```

example:
```
LIBPATHFILEDROP = /Users/iridescent/iridescent/iridescentCoconutSynth2/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-darwin-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/12.2.0/thumb/v7e-m+dp/hard
COMPILERPATH = /Users/iridescent/iridescent/iridescentCoconutSynth2/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-darwin-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/bin
TOOLSPATH = /Applications/Teensyduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools
```

to build:
```
cd iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython
make clean; make V=1 DEBUG=1
```

oh i forgot, i need to implement the /Applications/Teensyduino.app of which is required to load the firmware

if you want to get daring copy the python modules for kivy, virtual environment, numpy, intelbinhex, pygame, matplotlib, music21, et cetera :
```
cp -R iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython/modulesTakenOut/* iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython/modules/
```
and build again
doubtful there's any hardware that will support it at the moment, however due to tiny flash ram size on hardware

a board is in development for this firmware/OS

if you have kdbg installed through brew
you can run to debug in a very basic way
```
cd iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython; ./kdbg.sh
```

NOTE: need to add FLASHMEM to all micropython boot up steps and modify startup.c to run boot clock start
```
iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython/IRIDESCENT/cores-master/teensy4/startup.c
```
generate extern blocks on FLASHMEM with #include <avr/pgmspace.h> from:
```
iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython/board_init.c
```
AND THESE:
```
iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/lib/nxp_driver/sdk/devices/MIMXRT1062/system_MIMXRT1062.c
iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/lib/nxp_driver/sdk/devices/MIMXRT1062/system_MIMXRT1062.h
iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython/boards/MIMXRT1062_clock_config.c
iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython/boards/MIMXRT1062_clock_config.h
```
By inserting in: iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython/IRIDESCENT/cores-master/teensy4/startup.c in function void ResetHandler(void)

ALSO THESE FILES PROBABLY NEED FLASHMEM TOO (just in .h files) on functions (plus #include <avr/pgmspace.h>):
```
iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/lib/nxp_driver/sdk/devices/MIMXRT1062/fsl_device_registers.h
