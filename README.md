Teensy 4.1 should have at least 16MB or more of external RAM soldered into Teensy 4.1 PSRAM pads. Should either be soldered or connected to the Teensy Audio Adapter Card, also Teensy Audio Adapter Card should have an additional 2Gbit of Flash RAM soldered in the Audio Adapter.

installing
```
mkdir iridescentBUILD; cd iridescentBUILD
git checkout https://github.com/8888clockradio/iridescentmicropython.git
```

edit iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/toolchain.mk

change
```
LIBPATHFILEDROP = $(abspath ../arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-darwin-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/12.2.0/thumb/v7e-m+dp/hard)
COMPILERPATH = $(abspath ../arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-darwin-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/bin)
```

to the path of your arm-none-eabi gcc and g++ toolchain, try and use current versions not the Teensyduino.app included one
download arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-darwin-arm64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz or similar from
```
https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads
```

copy the .xz file to iridescentBUILD/
extract the .xz file in iridescentBUILD/
should look like
```
iridescentBUILD/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-darwin-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/...
```

example:
```
LIBPATHFILEDROP = $(abspath ~/iridescentBUILD/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-darwin-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/12.2.0/thumb/v7e-m+dp/hard)
COMPILERPATH = $(abspath ~/iridescentBUILD/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-darwin-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/bin)
```

to build:
```
cd iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython
make clean; make V=1 DEBUG=1
```

oh i forgot, i need to implement the /Applications/Teensyduino.app of which is required to load the firmware

if you want to get daring copy the python modules for kivy, virtual environment, numpy, intelbinhex, pygame, matplotlib, music21, et cetera... :
```
cp -R iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython/modulesTakenOut/* iridescentBUILD/iridescentmicropython/ports/libmicropython/modules/
```
and build again
doubtful there's any hardware that will support it at the moment, however due to tiny flash ram size on hardware

a board is in development for this firmware/OS
